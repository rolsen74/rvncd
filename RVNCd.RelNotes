RVNCd v1.1 ( 16-Jul-2023 )

- First Release


RVNCd v1.2 ( 21-Jul-2023 )

- Added STARTSERVER, STOPSERVER, RESTARTSERVER, SERVERSTATUS, QUIT 
  commands to ARexx port.

- Added DelayFrequency option to Server group config. So you can control
  how much cpu time the reading gfx memory uses.

- Added AutoStart option to Server group. If you want to auto launch the
  server at startup.

- Added SendClipBoard option, controls if Server sends CB to client.

- Added ReadClipBoard option, controls if we are ignoring Client CB message.

- Log config Enable, now controls to enable or disable file loggin.

- Log ProgramStartStop and ServerStartStop have been split into its
  own config settings, so you better can control what to log.

- Log UserConnect, now controls if you want to add a entry to logfile
  when a user connects.

- Fixed a bug that could result in a crash in gfx read on shutdown.

- Changed shutdown signals of subprocesses so we can avoid error
  messages on user CTRL+C.


RVNCd v1.3 ( 24-Jul-2023 )

- Fixed a possible crash in Server shutdown code. Where a 
  ReleaseCopyOfSocket() KeyID got passed to CloseSocket().

- Reworked buffer handling, where sending a single tile at a time per
  client UpdateRequest packet. Now its send all changed tile per request.
  This makes UpdateSync a lot faster.

- The Server now support the client request of updated Tiles or the hole
  screen.


RVNCd v1.4 ( 26-Jul-2023 )

- Changes dir to progdir: on program start. So Loading of Config file and 
  Adding to Log file now defaults to progdir:

- Disk functions changed from c library to direct DOS calls.

- Added Numeric Keypad support.

- Added Session info that will be printed on user disconnect.


RVNCd v1.5 ( 29-jul-2023 )

- You can now set a password (max 8 chars) with the Password option in the
  config file.

- Work on Mouse Pointer Image is still ongoing .. its still not finished
  it may work.. but I ran out of time for now. Uncomment it in config
  to test it out.


RVNCd v1.6 ( 29-jul-2023 )

- Fixed Pointer rendering on 16 bit screens.

- Added pointer mask, if Alpha channel is 25 or less it will be set to
  transparent.


RVNCd v1.7 ( 30-Aug-2023 )

- Some clients do not like the server sending BufferUpdates if they have not
  asked for them. The Pointer image update, is send as a BufferUpdate
  so joining gfx updates and pointer updates into one send buffer fixed the
  cursor error.

- Added the very first GUI elements. its still very much alpha.. work in
  progress.

- Added a GUI Key Logger window .. open it from the menus. will proberly
  change that later but for now thats how to do it.

- ARexx's ServerStatus command now have 5 return values ..
  Stopped / Starting / Running / Shutting down / Unknown

- Added build in Amiga Mouse pointer. Will be shown if client supports it.
  Image can be replace from setting in config file.

- Extended the config parser. You can now create Server config groups with
  [ServerCfg:x] where x is a group id (must be positive).
  Whitelist ip's can now have a config id number like 
  "IP = 192.168.1.211 [2]". This is optional.
  ServerCfg groups still have no options, its work in progress.


RVNCd v1.8 ( 31-Aug-2023 )

- Reworked starting and stopping of subprocesses. It should be more robust 
  now. I Hope its will make it more stable running, when users connect and
  disconnect.

- Now i'm setting the Main process name on startup, so its easier to find 
  if started from shell.

- Added gui to show Pixel Format used with client. WIP.


RVNCd v1.9 ( 04-Sep-2023 )

- Lots of gui work. Internal config change.


RVNCd v1.10 ( 09-Sep-2023 )

- More gui work. Finished Client Info window. Finished the Program page.

- Added Menu to Save 'Default' config file.


RVNCd v1.11 ( 15-Sep-2023 )

- Fixed reading autostart checkmark button. Reading INTEGER_Number instead
  of GA_Selected tag from Gadget resulted it in it always being Zero.

- Fixed KeyLogger crash. If the KeyLogger window havent been opened,
  the first key press would try to add a message to an uninitalized list.

- Finished Config SaveAS menu.

- Save Default and SaveAS menu .. remembers the file+path so it becomes the
  active config file, so Save uses this path.

- Added LOADCONFIG <file> ARexx command.

- Added SAVECONFIG ARexx command.

- Added SAVEASCONFIG <file> ARexx command.

- Added SAVEDEFAULTCONFIG ARexx command.


RVNCd v1.12 ( 17-Sep-2023 )

- Added Iconify function to all windows.


RVNCd v1.13 ( 18-Sep-2023 )

- Moved some stack buffers on to temp allocated memory. This fixed a gui 
  crash. If we are lucky it also fixes the random crash on exit.

- Fixed client gadget width, so its now wide enough to display the text.

- Removed all code for OpenGUI option, as its nolonger used.

- Fixed error warnings in ARexx code. Were disabled when changing log system.

- Added a timer that will update the Client window if open.

- More gui work .. now you can move entries in the White/Black list. still WIP.


RVNCd v1.14 ( 24-Sep-2023 )

- Changed: In case of failing to open ARexx class, it simply disables ARexx
  prints a warning and continues.

- Changed memory allocating system to only use either c lib or Exec no more
  mixed allocation. Controled by a switch in the makefile.

- Added 3 new shell commands .. nogui, nobroker and noarexx.

- The Server process have been split into two processes so accept() is now
  handled all the time, and not only when waiting for a user. For this to
  work a lot of code shuffling had to be done, so that proberly broke 
  something. You can see the effect that new users get rejected while you
  are connected.

 - Added more error messages if something goes wrong.


RVNCd v1.15 ( 24-Sep-2023 )

- Added error messages if gui fails to open.

- Renamed the new shell command nobroker to nocxbroker.

- Fixed: The CxBroker will not have Hide/Show buttons if DisableGUI or
  --nogui flags have been set.


RVNCd v1.16 ( 25-Sep-2023 )

- Reenabled delay at startup, where client can send PixelFormat.

- Reenabled first update is a fullscreen


RVNCd v1.17 ( 21-Oct-2023 )

- When reading from the Net, moved buffers of the Stack and onto a 
  preallocated one that is 4k alligned. I hope this fixes mobaxterm 32bit
  color problem.


RVNCd v1.18 ( 29-Oct-2023 )

- Sending messages now also have a 4k aligned buffer.

- A little gui work trying to make universal function to handle windows.


RVNCd v1.19 ( 04-Nov-2023 )

- Added a memory mugwall, can be activated with --mugwall via shell only.

- When registering Application i'm telling it not to load and save prefs.

- When Sending RectHeader and RichCursor's data, its moved into the SendBuffer.
  That should the last of the buffers.. they are now all in either the Read
  or the Send buffer. This should avoid any problem with buffers on the stack
  where the Roadshow cache flushes or invalidate some of my other data.
  Those buffers are 4k page aligned plus continues.

- Refactored the Tile Rendering functions.

- Refactored grapping of screen data. Plus it also have its own buffer that
  is page alligned and continues.

- This version have lots of debug .. during start and stopping.

- Improved the 'user disconnect' detection code.

- When client requested an update and there were no gfx change, no message was 
  send. This resulted in client waiting for an update and server waited for another
  request. Server now wait for something to change and then sends the answer.

- Changed each process shutdown function to print an message for each 5s that
  it waits for the completion of shutdown.

- All internal Delay(1) have been changed to Delay(2) so now each process
  sleeps a little longer its now 2/50 sec (50 ticks are 1 sec). Too much
  wasted cpu time.. when the system needed to swap task becoarse of a short
  Delay(1), simply too much overhead.. so now we are trying Delay(2).

- The listening port is now set into REUSE mode. If you try to use a port that
  another server also uses, there can be confilicts. so make sure to use a 
  unique port number. But other than that we should have got rid of the Port 
  in use problem when restarting.

- Config file now have a new option UserDisconnect in the Log Section.

- Changed the config option 'GfxRead_TileSize' back too the correct name 
  'TileSize'. I must have done a global search and replace at some point.

- Changed the make script to not include a config file.. You can open the gui
  and save one if you need it for now (via menus)...  once we finish this 
  program I can add default one.

- When Pixel Format was changed, the gui was not always updated.

- Main window title now includes version number and release date

- Split Debug window pages into own Windows.

- Made a user Accecpt/Reject counter. Not sure its worth keeping. 


RVNCd v1.20 ( 04-Nov-2023 )
