[Shell]

 Running from shell you can use thise arguments

 RVNCd [options]

 -v or --verbose : will print info what it's doing

 -p or --port : will set the port to use, overwriting the config file setting.

 -c or --config : to configure which config file to use.

 -h or --help : print the shell options.

By default, it will load the 'RVNCd.Config' file.


[ARexx]

 The ARexx port address is named 'RVNCD'.

 - STARTSERVER -
  Will start the server if not running. Calling this while it's running does 
  no harm. The result value should be examined to see if it started or not.

 - STOPSERVER -
  Will stop the server if running. Calling this while it's stopped
  does no harm.

 - RESTARTSERVER -
  Will first stop the server if running and then start it (again).
  Calling this even if it's not running is okay; it will then just
  start the server, just like STARTSERVER. The result should be examined
  to see if the server started or not.

 - SERVERSTATUS -
  Returns status if it's running or not.

 - QUIT -
  Will shutdown the server if running and then exit.
 

[CONFIG]

  The config file is split into groups that starts and stop with [].

  [Program]

  - Verbose -
  Controls if Information is printed to shell during operation.
  Its better to use the shell option -v as using this setting only takes
  effect when meet inside the config file. Meaning it matter if its placed
  in top of the config file or in the bottom.
  Default: 0 (False)

  Controls if the Server Name that is exchanged on init.
  Default: Amiga VNC Server

  This controls how many tiles that will be check for
  graphic change before doing a Pause. Setting it to Zero will run
  at full speed.
